                <h3><strong>HTML, CSS and JS</strong></h3>
                <p>I have spent almost a year perfecting my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. I particularly enjoy transitions and personally I think that almost any website can benefit from spicing their content up a bit with subtle transitions. I have also learnt methodologies such as <strong>BEM</strong> - a HTML methodology that allows you to code more efficiently and is universal so other developers that take over your work will be able to understand it. I have also learnt the methodology known as <strong>OOCSS</strong> - Object Oriented CSS is a methodology that is based around creating reusable classes which if done correctly can make you code faster and without having the need to type the same styles on different elements over and over again. These are just one of the many methodologies that I have come across that I try to implement into my work. Should you want to inspect this website you will see that I have used these methodologies to code this website.</p>

                <h3><strong>Responsive Web Design</strong></h3>
                <p>I know how to code websites and optimise them for all sorts of devices. This means that your website will look good on mobile, laptops and desktops. Responsive Web Design in the concept of adapting content for all the different screen sizes. This is because as years have gone by, technology has become better and more sophisticated therefore you will find that a couple of years ago when users viewed your website on desktop mainly, now you will find that more and more users are viewing your website on mobile. This means that your website must be adapted for mobiles and that doesn't mean just moving around content like some people think.</p>

            <div class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-xl-6">
                <h3><strong>Mobile First Approach</strong></h3>
                <p>I make websites using the Mobile First approach. It caters for the smallest screens first and then adapts to larger screens. This is quickly becoming the norm for many web developers and designers as they are realising that most of their profit is coming from mobile devices rather than desktops. This is because we lead extremely busy lives and therefore may only have time to view a website on mobile whilst on the go. For me, I know that I use my mobile for viewing everything from youtube videos to making payments on Ebay. So it is absolutely crucial that websites nowadays must put mobile users as top priority because there is just simply too many people viewing websites on mobiles to take the risk of leaving them out.</p>

                <h3><strong>Bootstrap and Foundation</strong></h3>
                <p>I stumbled upon two of the best coding tools since learning web design. Zurb Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap. These frameworks have allowed me to code more efficiently. Bootstrap is my favourite because of its wide array of components and classes that can add loads of style and functionality to your website with minimal effort. I have only recently started learning Bootstrap (about two weeks ago in fact) and I find it to be highly awesome. It is easy to learn and as a matter of fact, this website you are viewing has been designed using Bootstrap so I have quite a good grasp on it.</p>

                <h3><strong>CMS</strong></h3>
                <p>I specialise in Concrete5 and Wordpress. Both these CMS's are great but from what I have experienced there are two types of clients. Those who want a wordpress like site with big hero images and full width header will opt for Wordpress even though there is a lot of PHP involved in the development of a Wordpress site. I know enough PHP to comfortably modify templates in Wordpress. However, my favourite is Concrete5. Its simplicity and usability for both the developer and clients is the reason I chose to specialise in this CMS. You can do anything that Wordpress can do but easier (in my opinion). I can code for both these CMS's comfortably.</p>

            <h3><strong>Proof of my determination and hard work</strong></h3>
                <p>In my own time I have been learning many different things related to Web Design that help make me a better front-end developer. I have spent so much time and effort into documenting and practising what I have learnt that I would like to show you the amount of work that I did and all the different subjects that I looked into. From all of this, I enjoyed learning about methodologies and CSS transitions. Every developer has their own way of coding and has their own techniques. I use proven techniques such as BEM and OOCSS that have been known to make you code faster and with minimal mistakes. <strong>If you would like me to send you any files I would be more than happy to get them across to you.</strong></p>
