				<h2 class="page-header">About Me</h2>

				<p class="jumbotron"><strong>My name is Azeem Khan. I am an aspiring web designer who constantly thrives to produce fresh and unique websites to my clients. I have spent months and months learning and striving to be like the best web designers out there.</strong></p>

				<h3 class="well">2015 - Found the world of code during exam leave</h3>

				<p  class="jumbotron">I am young and enthusiastic individual who loves everything about web design. I left school after having completed my GCSE's and my A-levels in 2015. Just like any other student at that stage, I was thinking about what career I wanted to go into in the future. I came to a realization that I should do what I enjoy most and since I enjoyed being on my computer 24/7 I decided to use it to my advantage. I researched around and came across web development and had a look into some of the languages needed to become a web developer. This is when I found the three kings of web development, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I fell in love with coding and how I could learn something in such a short amount of time and see the beautiful results on my browser. I loved seeing the different elements of the website come to life as I coded them.</p>

				<h3 class="well"> 2015/2016 - What I did after having learnt coding?</h3>

				<p class="jumbotron">After having learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript, I decided to apply for an apprenticeship at 3aaa. They helped me find placements and I found a place at Melt Design in Warwick. 4 months after, I moved closer to home in Coventry and learnt under the rule of Nigel Copley - a very clever man and one of the greatest guys I know. He let me learn all on my own without any pressure and with so much guidance. This is where I learnt all the rest of my skills. You can learn more about what I can offer you as a web developer on the <a href="services.html">Services</a> page</p>

				<h3 class="well">Goals and Aspirations</h3>

				<p class="jumbotron">Although I may talk like I know everything, there is a lot that I still want to learn. I need to get better at my design skills and would like to develop my Photoshop skills. Being able to create mockups is a key part of being a great developer and designer. I also would like to learn Javascript and Jquery at a much higher level as I know it well enough to implement to a basic level. I would also like to learn more about the marketing side of web design. What makes users come to your site? How can you keep the user interested? I would like to learn more about the psychological process that a user takes and how I, as a web designer/developer, can cater my websites to aid that process <br/> My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded web developer and designer that can make awesome websites!</p>
